libVGF

This is the libVGF library (standing for lib-Very Good File).
The purpose of this library is to create a small library for reading and writing statically sized chunks of binary data
to files without the need to put it in a specific file type or in a human-readable format. This could be practical for
storing 3d model data and such.

Since it's not really that useful, consider the library available under PUBLIC DOMAIN or CC0 1.0
(see here: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Cannot guarantee that this library won't have: memory leaks, obvious bugs, or cause your whole PC to wipe itself then blowup
and lead to WW3 (AKA, there is no WARRANTY).
